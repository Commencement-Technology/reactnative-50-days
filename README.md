# Day 5 Animated Cards

The AnimatedCards component displays a list of cards (Master or Visa) that can be expanded when pressed. When a card is expanded, the component navigates to the CardDetail screen. The cards are animated with React Native Reanimated, and the animations include moving the cards to their expanded positions, changing the opacity of the close button, and translating the title.

# Day 9 Dial Button

The Dial Button Component is a custom circular menu, featuring a central button surrounded by six selectable icons. When the central button is pressed, the menu expands or collapses with a smooth animation. Each selectable icon is positioned along the circumference of the circle, and an animated icon indicator highlights the currently selected icon. The component is built using React Native and the react-native-reanimated library.
