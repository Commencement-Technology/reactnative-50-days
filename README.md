# React Native 50 Days UI Challenge

This repository contains my implementation of the React Native 50 Days UI Challenge. In this challenge, I will be creating 50 different UI designs using React Native.

---

## Day 1 - Bouncy Onboarding

Bouncy Onboarding component slides its content either to the left or right.

## Day 2 - Circular Onboarding

Circular Onboarding component shows the process of onboarding screens using a circle and also contains an animated dot indicator to show the current screen.

# Day 3 Dynamic Tabs

This React Native component is a customizable, dynamic, and animated tab bar with a paginator. The implementation uses a ScrollView with pagingEnabled set to true to mimic the behavior of native tabs. The component is designed to provide a smooth and interactive user experience when navigating between tabs.

# Day 4 Sticky Header

Sticky Header component that interpolates its content to the Y-axis origin based on the defined value.

# Day 5 Animated Cards

The AnimatedCards component displays a list of cards (Master or Visa) that can be expanded when pressed. When a card is expanded, the component navigates to the CardDetail screen. The cards are animated with React Native Reanimated, and the animations include moving the cards to their expanded positions, changing the opacity of the close button, and translating the title.
