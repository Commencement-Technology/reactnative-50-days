# React Native 50 Days UI Challenge

This repository contains my implementation of the React Native 50 Days UI Challenge. In this challenge, I will be creating 50 different UI designs using React Native.

---

## Day 1 - Bouncy Onboarding

Bouncy Onboarding component slides its content either to the left or right.

## Day 2 - Circular Onboarding

Circular Onboarding component shows the process of onboarding screens using a circle and also contains an animated dot indicator to show the current screen.

# Day 3 Dynamic Tabs

This React Native component is a customizable, dynamic, and animated tab bar with a paginator. The implementation uses a ScrollView with pagingEnabled set to true to mimic the behavior of native tabs. The component is designed to provide a smooth and interactive user experience when navigating between tabs.

# Day 4 Sticky Header

Sticky Header component that interpolates its content to the Y-axis origin based on the defined value.
